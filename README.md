## Note

This application currently runs on a local host and is intended for development and testing purposes only. To make it publicly accessible, you will need to deploy the application to a public host.

#### Converting to a Public Host

To make the file-sharing app publicly accessible, consider deploying the backend server using services like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean, and the frontend using platforms like Vercel or Netlify. Ensure you update the API endpoints in your frontend code to match the deployed backend server.
